Standards
=========

The ``cryptosystems`` library references to the highest standards of security and cryptography, including those set forth by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. This ensures that the implementation aims to follow the best established practices and recommendations for secure cryptographic algorithms, key exchange protocols, hash functions and mathematical utilities.

Below is a list of key **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)** and **Special Publications (SPs)** that were referred:
